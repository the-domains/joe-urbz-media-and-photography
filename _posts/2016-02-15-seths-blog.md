description: "Two guys are running away from an angry grizzly when one stops to take off his hiking boots and switches to running shoes. \"What are you doing,\" the other guy yells, \"those aren't going to allow you to outrun the bear...\" The other guy smiles and points out that he doesn't have to outrun the bear, just his friend."
